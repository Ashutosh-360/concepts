Indexes support efficient execution of queries in MongoDB. Without indexes,
 MongoDB must scan every document in a collection to return query results. If an appropriate index exists for a query, 
 MongoDB uses the index to limit the number of documents it must scan.

Although indexes improve query performance, adding an index has negative performance impact for write operations. 
For collections with a high write-to-read ratio, indexes are expensive because each insert must also update any indexes.

Specify an Index Name
When you create an index, you can give the index a custom name.
Giving your index a name helps distinguish different indexes on your collection. 

Before you specify an index name, consider the following:
Index names must be unique. Creating an index with the name of an existing index returns an error.
You can't rename an existing index. Instead, you must drop and recreate the index with a new name.

Default Index Names
If you don't specify a name during index creation, the system generates the name by concatenating each index key field and value with underscores.
