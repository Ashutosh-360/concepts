What is node js

Node.js is a server-side runtime environment built on Google Chrome's JavaScript Engine (V8 Engine).
Node.js was developed by Ryan Dahl in 2009 and its latest version is v20.9.0. 
Node.js is a cross-platform (run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more), open-source,
back-end JavaScript runtime environment,that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

Features of Node.js
Asynchronous and Event Driven − All APIs of Node.js library are asynchronous, that is, non-blocking. 
It essentially means a Node.js based server never waits for an API to return data. The server moves to the next API after calling it and a notification mechanism of Events of Node.js helps the server to get a response from the previous API call.

Very Fast − Being built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine, Node.js library is very fast in code execution.

Single Threaded but Highly Scalable − Node.js uses a single threaded model with event looping. 
Event mechanism helps the server to respond in a non-blocking way and makes the server highly scalable as opposed to traditional servers which create limited threads to handle requests.
Node.js uses a single threaded program and the same program can provide service to a much larger number of requests than traditional servers like Apache HTTP Server.

No Buffering − Node.js applications never buffer any data. These applications simply output the data in chunks.

const http = require('http');
The APIs in Node.js are asynchronous which means that they do not cause blockers. This happens due to the Node.js server not waiting for the return of data once an API has been called. It moves on to the next API. Instead, there is a notification mechanism that gets the response from the prior API call. Thus, we can also say that Node.js is event-driven.
Node.js is powered by the Google Chrome V8 JavaScript Engine. This makes code execution in the Node.js library super fast.
Node.js is based on a single-thread model with event looping. The event mechanism in the Node.js library makes it highly scalable because it prevents blockers on the server as compared to other servers that can only handle limited requests. In Node.js, the single thread program can service copious requests compared to something like Apache HTTP Server.
Because of the event mechanism in Node.js, there is no buffering. Instead, the data output occurs in chunks.
